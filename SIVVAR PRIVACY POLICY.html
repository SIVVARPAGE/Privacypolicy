<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the SIVVAR Terms of Service. Your use of the SIVVAR site, SIVVAR software, the SIVVAR service, and any personal information you provide on the SIVVAR Site or SIVVAR Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Please note that any content posted at the direction or discretion of users of the SIVVAR Service becomes published content and is not considered as personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</b></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is part of SIVVAR's <bold><i>Terms of Service</i></bold> and covers the treatment of user information, including personally identifying information obtained by SIVVAR, information obtained when you access the SIVVAR Site, use the SIVVAR Service or any other software provided by TheCodec Systems Limited.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that SIVVAR does not own or control, or to individuals whom SIVVAR does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which SIVVAR may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>The Information SIVVAR Collects</b></p>

<p>SIVVAR may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below ("Personally Identifying Information"):</p>

<p><b>User Provided Information</b> 
    
    You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number, push notification name (if applicable), billing information (if applicable) and mobile device information to SIVVAR when choosing to participate in various SIVVAR Service, such as registering as a user, accessing an IVR service, speaking to Third party Contact Centres through the SIVVAR app etc. in order to allow you use the SIVVAR Service, SIVVAR will periodically access the database of third party organisations listed on SIVVAR and query their database to ascertain if you are one of their customers before giving you access to some services as the need arises. </p>

<p><b>Log File Information</b> When you use the SIVVAR app, our servers may automatically record voice prompts or certain information you supplied while accessing services via the Dual Tone Multi Frequency(DTMF) key strokes of the SIVVAR app. These server logs may include information such as your response from an Interactive Voice Response (IVR), voice prompts, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, mobile phone type and model, language options, start time/stop time, browser type, referring / exit pages, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of your request. When you use the SIVVAR Service, our servers log certain general information that our application sends whenever an IVR is accessed, or if you contact any third party Contact centre listed on SIVVAR, including time and date stamps and the organisations you contacted.</p>

<p><b>The Information SIVVAR Does Not Collect</b></p>

<p>SIVVAR does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users' call log or address book other than missed call notification during initial registration verification process and messages―if missed call verification fails. We do not collect location data, but users may voluntarily share their location with third party organisations listed on SIVVAR if the need arises.</p>

<p>The contents of calls routed through the SIVVAR Service are not copied, kept or archived by SIVVAR in the normal course of business. Third party organisations whom you access might, however, record your call for their organisational purposes, and would inform you before doing that.</p>

<p>The SIVVAR Service is meant to be a Toll Free Voice Service replacement (in an environment where toll free calls are difficult to access and people spend their hard earned mobile airtime in speaking to IVR systems before being attended to by humans after spending endless time waiting), using data service, through a user's phone (either via GSM network or wifi). Users click the service they intend to access, and such requests will be transmitted via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended organisation (that must be listed on SIVVAR). If the desired organisation is not online, the user gets a voice notification with adequate information to advice otherwise. </p>

<p>Once a call has been connected, it does not reside on our servers anymore. The call details of any successfully connected calls are not kept or retained by SIVVAR at the end of the call. Such details may contain date and time stamp information associated with the connected calls, and the mobile phone numbers involved in the connection, as well as any other information which SIVVAR is legally compelled to collect. </p>

<p><b>The Way SIVVAR Uses Information</b></p>

<p>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the SIVVAR Site, or SIVVAR Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you, the features and functionality of the SIVVAR App and SIVVAR Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the SIVVAR Service and will be retained. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature, with the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major SIVVAR App or SIVVAR Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the SIVVAR App and SIVVAR Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the SIVVAR Service or SIVVAR Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views, etc.</p>

<p><b>When SIVVAR Discloses Information</b></p>

<p>Other users of the SIVVAR Service may not see your number as SIVVAR has not been created for SIVVAR to SIVVAR calls, but SIVVAR to IVR Systems, Contact Centres listed on SIVVAR, and other Interactive Services. Only organisations you dial on SIVVAR will be able to see your mobile number, and might call you back if the need arise. We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent, except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the SIVVAR Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the SIVVAR App and SIVVAR Site. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in good-faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as Nigerian Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual's physical safety may be at risk or threatened. SIVVAR also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that SIVVAR believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the SIVVAR App and SIVVAR Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SIVVAR, our users or others.</p>

<p><b>Your Choices</b></p>

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the SIVVAR App, SIVVAR Site or the SIVVAR Service, in which case SIVVAR may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please delete your account, uninstall the SIVVAR mobile application and discontinue the use of the SIVVAR Service; your continued usage of the SIVVAR Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as missed call verification, and SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and granting you access to the SIVVAR Services. Please contact the SIVVAR support team by either leaving a short voice message using the “TELLSIVVAR” service on the SIVVAR App, or by sending a mail to sivvar@thecodecsystems.com or by filling a web form on the SIVVAR Site (www.sivvar.com) with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.</p>

<p><b>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</b></p>

<p>SIVVAR App is currently ad-free and we hope to keep it that way, but we might introduce ads later to take care of servers and services maintenance cost as the needs arise. However, the ads would not be intrusive. This privacy will be adequately updated when we decided to introduce advertisements.</p>

<p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b></p>

<p>SIVVAR App uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to SIVVAR App and SIVVAR Site, and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured Wifi or other unprotected networks to access voice services through the SIVVAR Service is never recommended. Once we receive your request to transmit information with the SIVVAR App, SIVVAR makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of your information. However, note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. The moment the SIVVAR team learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so you can take appropriate protective steps. SIVVAR may post a notice on the SIVVAR App (on the Info Page of SIVVAR), SIVVAR Site or through the SIVVAR Service if a security breach occurs.</p>

<p><b>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</b></p>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, SIVVAR does not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information or non-personally-identifiable information on the SIVVAR App, SIVVAR Site or SIVVAR Service from persons under 16 years of age, and no part of the SIVVAR Service is directed to or intended to be used by persons under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use the SIVVAR App, SIVVAR Service or access the SIVVAR Site at any time or in any manner. If SIVVAR learns that Personally Identifiable Information of persons under 16 years of age has been collected on the SIVVAR App, SIVVAR Site or SIVVAR Service, then SIVVAR may deactivate such account. </p>

<p><b>Special Note to International Users</b></p>

<p>The SIVVAR App, SIVVAR Site and SIVVAR Services are hosted on Private Cloud Servers and are intended for and directed to users in Nigeria. If you are a user accessing the SIVVAR Site and Services from United States of America, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Asia, other African countries or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from Nigerian laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the SIVVAR App, Site and Services, which are governed by Nigerian laws, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to Nigeria and you expressly consent to that transfer, and consent to be governed by the laws of Federal Republic of Nigeria for these purposes.</p>

<p><b>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</b></p>

<p>In the event that SIVVAR is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>

<p><b>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</b></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the SIVVAR App, SIVVAR Site and SIVVAR Services constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments. </p>
